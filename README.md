# Config files for various things

## PowerShell config

Make sure to put it into the `~\Documents\PowerShell\` folder


## Tmux

Not sure where to place the file, but it's got the settings I like, they can also be manually typed into tmux `CTRL-b :` and `set mouse` for instance.

`$> tmux` launches a new session with no name

`$> tmux a` attaches to the first session
